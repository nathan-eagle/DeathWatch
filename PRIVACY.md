**Last Updated: March 1, 2025**

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how Death-Watch ("we", "our", or "us") handles your information when you use our Apple Watch application. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you understand what limited data our app uses.

## Summary

**Death-Watch is designed with privacy as a core principle:**
- We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information to external servers
- All data is stored locally on your device
- No analytics or tracking tools are implemented
- No third-party services process your data

## Information We Don't Collect

Death-Watch does not collect or transmit:
- Personal identifiers
- Location data
- Usage statistics
- Browsing history
- Contact information
- Health information
- Any other personal data

## Information Stored on Your Device

Death-Watch stores only the following information locally on your device:
- Your selected target date
- Your preferred display unit (hours, days, or weeks)

This information is stored using Apple's UserDefaults and is never transmitted off your device. It is used solely to provide the app's core functionality.

## Data Sharing

We do not share any data with third parties because we do not collect any data to share.

## App Permissions

Death-Watch does not request any special permissions beyond what is required for basic functionality.

## Children's Privacy

Our app does not collect information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect any personal data, there is no personal information for you to access, correct, update, or delete. Your target date and preferences can be modified or reset directly within the app.

## Data Retention

Your selected target date and preferences remain on your device until you:
- Change them within the app
- Delete the app from your device
- Reset your device

## Security

We implement appropriate technical measures to protect your locally stored preferences. Since no data is transmitted to external servers, the risk of data breaches is minimized.

## International Data Transfers

We do not transfer any data internationally because we do not collect or store data on external servers.
